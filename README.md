# Mathematical-Modelling-of-Epidermal-Wound-Healing
Epidermis is a very thin outermost layer of the skin. As the epidermal wound occurs, the platelets and fibrin, a protein that is involved in clotting surround the wound and clot so that the wound does not bleed. Due to the biophysical and biochemical complexity of the process, it is not clearly understood. Mathematical modeling of the whole process, will not only help us increase our understanding of the wound healing process and timing, it will also provide biological insight of the process, which can be used to perform experiments mathematically that will have good medical implications.
